# Crosshair-Manager
Crosshair Manager is a hub for use in gaming (doesn't work in for games in Fullscreen only work around I found was to have admin privileges and I'm not doing that)
To run find the executable within the project there will be three buttons which all pretty much explain what their purpose is. 
If you use this and find a bug shoot me a message or leave a comment so I can fix it any help is apreciated
